description: |
  Z80BENCH program allows you to measure and manage your MSX CPU speed.
  
  It has been created with not only Panasonic MSX with TurboPana and MSX TurboR machines in mind, but also FPGA machines OCM/MSX++, and MSX based on boards and hardware developments like Tides-Rider and Taka-Nami that allow different CPU speeds.
  
  The measurement is approximate and is based on the number of VDP interrupts that occur during a test loop in IM2 mode.
  
  This means that for low clock frequencies the precision is higher and as the speed increases the margin of error also increases.
  
  With longer test loops and longer duration, the margin of error would be reduced, but a compromise between precision and usability has been chosen.
  
  The available options vary depending on which MSX machine you run the program on.
  
  The visual presentation and operation is based on similar programs that were developed for old PCs under MS-DOS.
